    <p>
      At Pediatric Health Care Center, our <strong>General Check Up</strong> services are designed to ensure that every child 
      receives the attention, care, and preventive screening they need. Regular visits are important for early detection of possible 
      health issues, monitoring growth and development, and providing parents with guidance to support their child’s overall well-being. 
      Our goal is to create a safe, welcoming environment where children feel comfortable and parents feel confident about their child’s health.

  <h3>Why Is a General Check Up Important?</h3>
  <div class="checkup-why">
    <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/4359/4359963.png" alt="Healthy Child" class="checkup-img">
    <p>
      General check-ups are not only about finding illnesses, they are also about <strong>preventive care</strong>. 
      By regularly visiting the pediatrician, parents gain valuable advice on nutrition, sleep patterns, exercise, and even emotional well-being. 
      Many conditions such as anemia, allergies, asthma, or developmental delays can be managed better when detected early. 
      These visits also strengthen the relationship between the child and their doctor, building trust and reducing fear of hospitals or clinics.

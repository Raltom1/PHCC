    <p>
      At Pediatric Health Care Center, we believe that <strong>vaccinations</strong> are one of the most important ways to 
      protect children from serious and life-threatening diseases. Vaccines are safe, effective, and vital in ensuring that 
      children grow up healthy and strong. By following the recommended vaccination schedule, we help families secure a 
      healthier future for their children and the community.

  <h3>Why Vaccinations Are Important</h3>
  <div class="vax-importance">
    <p>
      Vaccinations do not only protect your child but also those around them by preventing the spread of infectious diseases. 
      They help reduce the risk of outbreaks in schools, playgrounds, and communities. With vaccines, illnesses such as measles, 
      mumps, polio, and whooping cough have significantly declined, saving millions of lives worldwide.

  <h3>Our Approach to Vaccination</h3>
  <div class="vax-approach">
    <p>
      Our medical team ensures that every vaccination is administered with utmost care and safety. 
      We follow the <strong>Department of Health (DOH) and World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> guidelines strictly. 
      Before each vaccination, our pediatricians provide a full explanation to parents about the vaccine, 
      its purpose, and any possible side effects. We also maintain accurate records to keep track of each 
      child’s vaccination history for future reference.
    </p>

  <h3>Parental Support and Guidance</h3>
  <p>
    We understand that some parents may have concerns or questions about vaccines. Our healthcare providers are here to 
    answer your questions and provide reassurance. Education sessions, pamphlets, and one-on-one discussions are available 
    to guide families and ensure they make informed decisions about their child’s health.

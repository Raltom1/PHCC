    <p>
      At Pediatric Health Care Center, we believe that <strong>good nutrition</strong> is the foundation of lifelong health. 
      Our <strong>Nutrition Counseling</strong> program is designed to help children develop healthy eating habits from an early age. 
      By working with families, our nutrition specialists provide personalized guidance to ensure that every child receives the 
      right balance of nutrients for their growth, energy, and overall development.
    </p>

  <h3>Why Nutrition Matters</h3>
  <div class="nutrition-importance vax-row reverse">
    <p>
      Proper nutrition is essential for a child’s physical growth, brain development, and immune system strength. 
      Poor eating habits can lead to obesity, malnutrition, anemia, and other health issues. By teaching children and 
      families about balanced diets, portion control, and food variety, we lay the groundwork for a healthier future.

      the right food choices, while children enjoy meals that support their growth and learning. Nutrition counseling is 
      not just about eating well—it’s about building lifelong habits for a healthier tomorrow.
